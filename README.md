# Leboncoin test - Andr√© Vieira

I'm using this repository to show my solution to the Leboncoin test.

# Start project 

To run the project please follow these steps:

- Go to the project folder
- Open a terminal and run `npm run install`
- Run `npm run start-server`
- Create a new `.env` file and insert the url that is presented in the terminal for the server.
- Open another terminal in the same location
- Run `npm run dev`
- Open your browser and insert `http://localhost:3000/`

# Walking through the project

### Home
This is the main page where the user can see all the conversations where it is either the sender or the reciever. Each item is a button to check the conversation's messages ([Conversation Details](#Conversation-details)).
The user can also create a new conversation ([New Conversation](#New-Conversation))!

### Conversation Details
The conversation details page shows the recepient nickname, the timestamp for the last message sent and the list of messages exchanged between these two users. At the bottom of the page the user can also send another message to add to the selected conversation.

### New Conversation
In this simple page the user can choose another user to create a new entry in the conversation array.


# Some logic behind it
### Server-side
Since some of the data is not being refreshed very often there are some components that use server-side rendering (SSR). To use this, I use `getServerSideProps` and retrieve some data. For example, in the [Home](#Home) component the conversations are fetched in the server side and the browser then displays it.

### Testing
The testing done was mainly used to see if the components showed the error messages when expected.
